# Ready for a game of Tic Tac Toe?

This is a Ruby program which allows a pair of players to play a game of Tic Tac Toe right in the console. It was created as part of [the Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby course.

You and a friend can [play the game online here](https://repl.it/@error34043/TicTacToe#main.rb)!
